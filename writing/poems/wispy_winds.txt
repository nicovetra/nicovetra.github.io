Wispy Winds
2026-01-23

Wispy winds

Talking in tongues

Slithering on highways

And blocking my driveway.



Wispy winds

Burying the lichens

Covering old men forgotten

Drowned out under this vast expanse.



And the winds whisper to me

Softly, as I go

Rollling down the highway

In this old prairie home.



And with them they bring

Stories of the mountains

and the sea, tiding me over

On these old prairie roads.



These wispy winds wail at me

Piercing my ears with stories unheard.

Brimming with tears, and longing for home

For all I have missed



I wallow in their whispers

In this old land forgotten

Bringing me back

To my old prairie home.
