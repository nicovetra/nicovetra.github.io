      <h1>Dichotomies</h1>
      <div class="meta">Poem · February 2, 2026</div>

      <div class="poem">

        Rolling down the street
With some close friends
For a cozy northern retreat

Out by the lake and the hills
Where the day drifts by at our will
We'll eat and drink well beyond our fill.

But as we pull up to a light,
The dichotomies of life hit us in the neck
Suffocating the words in my throat.

As we pass that unfortunate sight 
The thick air dries out my eyes
Pulling out tears, as would that cold windy night. 

The sight sends icicles sliding down my back,
Yet I am not the one outside in the cold;
I'll have warm hot chocolate, in someone's second home

As the light flickers to green, it cuts through that thick screen
Our words start tumbling and turning anew
Like a babbling brook, bursting out of winter blues.

We wind along to our final destination, full of excitement
Stepping out of the car to stretch 
Limbs that we had forgotten.

As we walk in, the crisp air inside
Raises the hair on our hides,
But how can I complain, when with a quick flick, we get heat.

As we make a rich and lovely dinner
I can't help but think back to the man in the street.
I even took a quick note, afraid I would forget.

Afraid I would be ignorant of the frigid world we live in
Cruel and unfair, wanting to see change
But terrified to give up our share.

I recall the man
Three cars ahead
Walking to windows
Agitatedly shaking his hands,
begging.

Like a pastor cupping his palms
Praying, perhaps asking the lord
To help his parishioners.

But a pastor lacks such intensity and despair,
Seething out of his body
Like cornered prey. 

It struck me more as a patient's' family
Crying out to god, delusions of life flowing
Through their poor sod.

Or a desperate human
Begging ancient nobles, down at their feet
For just a bushel of wheat, give us this day our daily bread.

I could not see the man's eyes, I wish I had.
But I could feel the despair
Strangle out any conversation.

Sinking in our seats, shying away in shame
It feels so hard to acknowledge our fellow human
And keep them a little more sane. 

We fear to give, for what it may be used
Perhaps it is a risk we must take
Since food, and more food

Cannot clothe the poor man, out on the street
Trembling and begging 
In the cold, freezing.
