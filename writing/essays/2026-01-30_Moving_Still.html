Stillness.

Petrified. Frozen. Unmoving.

Movement.

Fearless. Running. Changing.

Moving … Still.

Life always finds itself in one of these states. Often we find ourselves in a flux. Constantly changing, swirling, spinning, reorienting. We lose our footing on a descent, and find we can only regain it by moving swiftly.

But when we make it to the top of a hike, after a long day of constant movement, it is those sweet, still moments we try to imprint on our retinas. A mental snapshot to remember a beautiful view. A lovely scent. A delicious bite.

Without one the other cannot exist. But like yin and yang, movement and stillness must strike a balance.

Constantly moving is difficult. Take Sisyphus, cursed to be constantly moving. Moments spent being still, taking in the movement around us and basking in the moment's essence, are necessary. “One must imagine Sisyphus happy” as he takes in the view atop the hill. Before he must start all over again.

Without movement we cannot grow. Tossing and turning, grasping and fumbling. We have to move to learn.

We move away from home yearning for a less tumultuous one. We leave our close friends to sprint at some new ambitions. We move away from those we love when we can no longer exist with them. Life is in constant movement. And when we sit still, we might catch a fleeting glimpse of all that life can offer.

Take a breath. Observe the moment. Here we are still&ndash;listening to our desires. Reflecting on what we hope to achieve. But nothing can remain still forever. No matter how hard we clench and claw at time, hoping to freeze a delicate moment.

We are just moving … still.
